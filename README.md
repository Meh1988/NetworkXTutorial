# ðŸ“Š Network Centrality Analysis with NetworkX

This project performs social network analysis using Python's `NetworkX`, focusing on centrality measures, subgraph creation, and shortest path analysis. It includes two main parts:

- **Part A**: Centrality analysis on a directed graph from an edge list CSV.
- **Part B**: Facebook social network analysis using a public dataset.

---

## Project Structure

- `A`: Analyze a custom graph from CSV and visualize centrality measures.
- `B`: Analyze Facebook social graph and perform subgraph centrality analysis.
- `edges.csv`: Edge list (source â†’ target) for Part A.
- `facebook_combined.txt`: Facebook edge list for Part B.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib pandas numpy scipy
